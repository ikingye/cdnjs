When applied to a large block of text, trunk8 will cut off just enough text to prevent it from spilling over. Unlike conventional truncation that just limits the character length of text, trunk8 measures the content area for spill-over and intelligently chooses the text that best fits in the given space.","filename":"trunk8.min.js","homepage":"http://jrvis.com/trunk8/","keywords":["trunk8","text","truncate"],"license":"MIT","name":"trunk8","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/rviscomi/trunk8.git"},"version":"1.3.3","author":"Rick Viscomi <rviscomi@gmail.com> (http://jrvis.com/)"}
